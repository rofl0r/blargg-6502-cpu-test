; Serial I/O at 57600 bits/sec on controller port 2;
; Uses stack and register A only, and doesn't mind page crossing
; (uses subroutines instead of loops).
; Initialize serial and wait so PC won't receive junk for the first byte.
; Preserved: A, X, Y
serial_init:
	rts; Write byte A to serial
; Preserved: X, Y
serial_write:
	sta $2000
	.byte $fc, $13, $37     ; make syscall write using long-nop
	rts 			; 6; Wait for and read byte from serial into A
; Preserved: X, Y
